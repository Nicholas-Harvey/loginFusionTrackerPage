/* My current consultant position is at a company that makes an app that helps building engineers maintain their duty in legonella compliance; in short we help prevent the outbreak of a deadly disease. 
A large portion of my interest in Ziva is that you are a health and wellness company and are in that same vein of working to improve peoples lives.
I only apply to positions that I think are 'good' for society (educational websites, healthcare, etc) and having looked at your site and background I think we would be a great fit for one another. I would love to hear from you!  */
